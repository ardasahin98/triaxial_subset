                <h1>Behavior Type Selection Quiz</h1>
                <p>
                    This form is designed to guide you in selecting the behavior type based on cyclic laboratory test data. Each question includes two screenshots of laboratory test data for the “Last Cycle” and the “3% Strain Cycle.” The screenshots present only interpolated data (monotonic cubic spline) without any additional metrics. The total number of cycles is provided alongside the screenshots for better judgment of further cycles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The quiz comprises 64 test results with the following options for classification: “Sand-like behavior,” “Clay-like behavior,” “Intermediate behavior,” and “Data is not usable.” You may select only one option per question. If you wish to include comments, there is a separate optional section at the bottom of the form for that purpose.
